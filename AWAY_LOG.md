# Away-week loop log

_What the autonomous 15-minute loop did while Eitan was away — newest first, one line each. This is the quick-glance summary; full detail is in the git commit messages (each carries its own harsh self-criticism) and staged decisions are in `QUESTIONS.md`. The cloud GitHub beat runs the core program 24/7 underneath all of this regardless._

Repo home: **D:\AI-YouTube-Skills** (migrated off the full C: on 2026-07-23). Loop: CronCreate 15-min, session-only.

## 2026-07-23
- **~16:44 (fire 3, first true unattended fire — always-allow confirmed)** — Improved `memory_brain.recall`: it ranked only by keyword overlap, so ties fell back to store-iteration order and stale context could outrank fresh. Now the tiebreaker is RECENCY (newest `at` first), so agents reading the one-brain get the freshest relevant memory. Verified via CLI: equal-score hits now order Jul 23 → Jul 22 → Jul 11.
- **~15:59 (fire 2)** — Created this AWAY_LOG so you have a one-glance record of the loop's work without scrolling every commit. Also verified honestly: deterministic keyless enrichment is currently DRY (fresh-fusable pool = 0 — the drain/beat already reached everything with recoverable sources; the remaining ~2007 stubs need discovery or transcripts, not another fetch loop), and the One-Brain memory census is current (~9,016 records across 4 stores).
- **~15:44 (fire 1)** — Staged the next overhaul-audit decision batch (items 5–8: buy-Gemini-Pro / in-app-write / offline-keys / naming) into `QUESTIONS.md` with proposed verdicts for you to confirm on return. Per §7 the decisions are yours — the file was left OPEN, not auto-applied. Commit `e00b3f183`.
