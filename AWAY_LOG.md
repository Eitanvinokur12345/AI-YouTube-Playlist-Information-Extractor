# Away-week loop log

_What the autonomous 15-minute loop did while Eitan was away — newest first, one line each. This is the quick-glance summary; full detail is in the git commit messages (each carries its own harsh self-criticism) and staged decisions are in `QUESTIONS.md`. The cloud GitHub beat runs the core program 24/7 underneath all of this regardless._

Repo home: **D:\AI-YouTube-Skills** (migrated off the full C: on 2026-07-23). Loop: CronCreate 15-min, session-only.

## 2026-07-25
- **~19:03 (fire v129, unattended, Sonnet 5)** — Diagnosed the v128 done-counter "decline": it was bus.json
  snapshot churn (a bounded array ages completed tasks out), not lost work. The real cumulative counter
  already existed and only rises (`state.json.usage[dept].done`, sums to 4353 across 14 depts/659 beats).
  Wired it into `pulse._throughput()` + the Program pulse card, and fixed guardrail G-M which had the
  identical bug (false "STALLED" on bus churn) to key off the monotonic beat counter instead. Checked
  links/transcripts' 0-done pattern against `excava_agents.py` before writing it up: by design (pure
  relay departments), not a bug. `python -m src.pulse` / `node --check dashboard.js` / 15/15 guardrails
  all verified clean. Build v128→v129.
- **~19:24 prior day (fire v128, unattended, Opus)** — see SESSION_HANDOFF.md §0d for full detail (wired
  the previously-dead pulse tool into the beat + surfaced the done-counter regression in-app — the thing
  fire v129 above then diagnosed).

## 2026-07-24
- **~18:00 (fire 5, unattended)** — Shipped `src/pulse.py` → **PULSE.md** + `pulse.json`: one-glance "is it actually working?" status that federates guardrails, movement, drain, open questions, the away-log and recent commits into a single file at the repo root (open it, no server). It refuses to cheerlead — the first run surfaced a HIDDEN regression the green dashboard hid: the done-counter has fallen 1566→1256 over three days while "depts moving" sat flat at 12. Commit `24f0a3bb5`.

## 2026-07-23
- **~16:59 (fire 4, 2nd unattended)** — Added `python -m src.audit_decisions next [--stage]`: prints the next open §7 decision batch with proposed verdicts, and `--stage` appends it to QUESTIONS.md — so staging the 118 open decisions is one deterministic command instead of hand-writing each batch. Verified via CLI: prints items 5–8.
- **~16:44 (fire 3, first true unattended fire — always-allow confirmed)** — Improved `memory_brain.recall`: it ranked only by keyword overlap, so ties fell back to store-iteration order and stale context could outrank fresh. Now the tiebreaker is RECENCY (newest `at` first), so agents reading the one-brain get the freshest relevant memory. Verified via CLI: equal-score hits now order Jul 23 → Jul 22 → Jul 11.
- **~15:59 (fire 2)** — Created this AWAY_LOG so you have a one-glance record of the loop's work without scrolling every commit. Also verified honestly: deterministic keyless enrichment is currently DRY (fresh-fusable pool = 0 — the drain/beat already reached everything with recoverable sources; the remaining ~2007 stubs need discovery or transcripts, not another fetch loop), and the One-Brain memory census is current (~9,016 records across 4 stores).
- **~15:44 (fire 1)** — Staged the next overhaul-audit decision batch (items 5–8: buy-Gemini-Pro / in-app-write / offline-keys / naming) into `QUESTIONS.md` with proposed verdicts for you to confirm on return. Per §7 the decisions are yours — the file was left OPEN, not auto-applied. Commit `e00b3f183`.
